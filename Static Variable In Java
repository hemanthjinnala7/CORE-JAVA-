static variable is shared between all objects in an array 
in this example school name of every student is same
so assigning static to school name shows it is common
so we should not call static variable with object s1.school or s2.school or s3.school
we should call classname.school which is Student.school in this scenario


class Student
{
    static String School;
    int rollNo;
    String name;
    int marks;

    public void show()
    {
        System.out.println(School +" " +rollNo + " " + name + " " +marks);
    }

}

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String a[])
    {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        Student s2 = new Student();
        Student.School = "Pratibha Vidyalayam";
        s1.rollNo=1;
        s1.name="Hemanth";
        s1.marks=88;
        s2.rollNo=2;
        s2.name="Nma";
        s2.marks = 99;
        s1.show();
        s2.show();



    }
}
