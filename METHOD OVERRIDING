Your code snippet demonstrates **method overriding** in Java, which is a key feature of object-oriented programming. Let's break it down:

### Classes and Method Overriding:

1. **`Student` Class:**
   - This class has a method `add(int a, int b)` that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum (`a + b`).

2. **`AdvStudent` Class:**
   - This class extends `Student` and overrides the `add(int a, int b)` method. The overridden method returns the sum of the two integers plus one (`a + b + 1`).
   - Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

### Execution in `Main`:

1. **Creating an Instance:**
   - The `main` method creates an instance of `AdvStudent` named `ab`.
   
2. **Calling the `add` Method:**
   - When `ab.add(2, 3)` is called, it invokes the `add` method defined in `AdvStudent`, not the one in `Student`. Since the method is overridden, the implementation in `AdvStudent` is executed, which returns `2 + 3 + 1 = 6`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `System.out.println(ab.add(2, 3));` statement prints `6` to the console.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Method Overriding:** The `AdvStudent` class overrides the `add` method from the `Student` class. When the method is called on an instance of `AdvStudent`, the overridden version in `AdvStudent` is used.
  
- **Output:** The code correctly prints `6` because `AdvStudent`'s `add` method adds 1 to the sum of the two integers.

### Summary:

Your code correctly demonstrates the concept of method overriding in Java. When you call `add` on an `AdvStudent` object, it uses the overridden method, resulting in an output of `6`. This is different from multiple inheritance, which is not allowed in Java for classes. In Java, you can only extend one class, but you can implement multiple interfaces to achieve a form of multiple inheritance.
