creating a method to go to a shopkeeper and buying a pen 


class ShopKeeper {
    public String buy_pens(int x) 
    {
        if (x < 5)
        {
            return "Your amount isn't sufficient to buy a pen";
        } 
        else if (x % 5 == 0) 
        {
            int pens = x / 5;
            return "You can buy " + pens + " pens";
        } 
        else
        {
            int pens = x / 5;
            int change = x % 5;
            return pens + " pens and " + change + " change";
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShopKeeper shop = new ShopKeeper();
        System.out.println(shop.buy_pens(10));
        System.out.println(shop.buy_pens(7));
        System.out.println(shop.buy_pens(4));
    }
}
