from the scratch we are using static method in java (main method)
because
if we dont use static method then main method becomes a non-static method 
which means if you have to call main you have to create an object for public class {name}

we all know that main method is the starting point of execution .. 
if the execution is not started how can we call the object of class{name}

to solve this problem we maintian the main method as static
