we cannot use a non-static varaibles{instance variables} inside a static method 
we need not to create an object when we calling a static method inside your main method
the only way to use a non-static variable in static method is through passing the classname with a dummy object (example given below)


class Student {
    static String School;
    int rollNo;
    String name;
    int marks;

    public static void show(Student s) {
        System.out.println(s.rollNo + " " + School);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        Student s2 = new Student();
        Student.School = "Pratibha Vidyalayam";

        s1.rollNo = 1;
        s1.name = "Hemanth";
        s1.marks = 88;

        s2.rollNo = 2;
        s2.name = "Nma";
        s2.marks = 99;

        // Corrected calls to the show method
        Student.show(s1);
        Student.show(s2);
    }
}
