to compile you java code you need a java tool --> JDK{java development kit}
we write java code to compile the program but you think your system understands your java code
Noo... your system only understands only byte code....
so your java code converts into a byte code before it runs on a machine --> JVM {Java Virutal Machine}
so JVM helps you to run  your code 
JRE {java runtime enviornment}
to run your code .. it needs some extra files thats where jre will help you

JVM is a part of JRE
and finally JVM AND JRE are a part of JDK
JDK IS THE TOP LAYER AMONG JVM AND JRE

so when you install jdk in your system it will install updated jvm and updated jre in your system
